# Project Plan

## Title
The Impact of Weather Conditions on Traffic Accidents in NYC

## Main Question

How do different weather conditions effect the frequency and severity of traffic accidents in NYC?

## Description

Traffic accidents in urban areas like NYC can be influenced by various factors, including weather conditions. This project aims to analyze the relationship between weather conditions and traffic accidents in NYC. By using traffic accident data and weather data, we will identify patterns and correlations to understand how different weather conditions contribute to the occurrence and severity of traffic accidents. The findings can provide insights into effective measures to improve road safety under various weather conditions.
