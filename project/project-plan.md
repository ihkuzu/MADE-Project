# Project Plan

## Title
Analyzing Global Carbon Emissions and Their Impact on Climate Change

## Main Question

What is the connection between how much carbon we release into the air and the signs of climate change we see and how can we use this knowledge to come up with better ways to reduce the impact?

## Description

Climate change is a big problem that affects nature, money, and people all around the world. This project wants to study how the carbon we put into the air is linked to changes in the climate. We'll use data from the Global Carbon Atlas and NASA's climate change records to look at different aspects like how carbon emissions are changing, what effects they have on the climate and how different places are affected.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: Global Carbon Atlas
* Metadata URL: https://globalcarbonatlas.org/emissions/carbon-emissions/
* Data URL: https://carbon-atlas-emissions.wedodata.dev/index.php?lang=en#
* Data Type: CSV

Description: The Global Carbon Atlas provides comprehensive data on carbon emissions, including emissions by country, sector and fuel type, as well as carbon dioxide concentration levels in the atmosphere. This dataset offers valuable insights into global carbon emissions trends and their drivers.

### Datasource2: NASA Climate Change Data
* Metadata URL: https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/
* Data URL: https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/
* Data Type: CSV

Description: : NASA's climate change datasets encompass various indicators such as temperature records, sea level rise measurements and ice melt data. These datasets offer critical information for assessing the impacts of climate change and understanding the underlying mechanisms driving these changes.
